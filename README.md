# Face_Recognition

Face Detection and Recognition System
This repository contains Python scripts for face detection and recognition using Haar cascades and OpenCV. The scripts are designed to perform various tasks related to face detection and recognition, including:

- Detecting Faces in Images: The repository provides scripts to detect faces in images using Haar cascades. Different scripts are available for detecting faces with various functionalities, such as detecting faces in a group image, individual faces, or faces with age and gender estimation.
- Detecting Faces in Videos: There are scripts to detect faces in videos. One script processes a single video, while another script processes a group of videos and saves the output videos with detected faces in a specified folder.
- Recognizing Faces: The repository includes scripts for recognizing faces using Fisher Face Recognition. These scripts load known face images, train a recognition model, and then recognize faces in unknown images.

# Instructions to Run the Code
Follow these instructions to run the code:

- The rquired installation need to be performed in google colab.
  - installations required
  pip install opencv-python

- Before running the .py file, we need to upload the contents of the 'Uploads' folder in the Files section of google colab.
  - Uploads:
