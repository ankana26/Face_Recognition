# Face_Recognition

Face Detection and Recognition System
This repository contains Python scripts for face detection and recognition using Haar cascades and OpenCV. The scripts are designed to perform various tasks related to face detection and recognition, including:

- Utilized pre-trained Haar cascades for accurate face detection, distinguishing between frontal and profile faces.
- Implemented grayscale conversion for computational simplicity while retaining essential information.
- Integrated age and gender detection algorithms alongside face recognition for comprehensive analysis.
- Demonstrated real-time video processing capabilities for face detection and demographic analysis.
- Achieved practical implementations of face detection in videos and batch processing for scalability.
- Successfully identified known faces in group images and unknown images using face recognition techniques.
- Showcased versatility and adaptability in addressing various face detection scenarios.
- Identified potential areas for further optimization and improvement in performance, particularly in computational efficiency.
  
Concluded that the project exhibits proficiency in computer vision fundamentals and provides effective solutions for face detection tasks while suggesting avenues for future enhancements.

# Instructions to Run the Code
Follow these instructions to run the code:

- The rquired installation need to be performed in google colab.
  - installations required
  pip install opencv-python

- Before running the .py file, we need to upload the contents of the 'Uploads' folder in the Files section of google colab.
  - Uploads:
  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JLQ8FwVnHV9Ag4L45EudXsU00K50o9nJ/view?usp=sharing

- View Output: After running the script, the output will be displayed or saved based on the functionality of the script. For example, if you run a face detection script on images, it will display the images with detected faces. If you run a face recognition script, it will print the recognized faces along with their names.

- Due to the large size of ".ipynb" file and "Uploads" folder , we are not able to upload on github, So here are "colab" and "drive" links respctively:
